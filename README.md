# Project Repo Template & GitHub Classroom Instructions

**Purpose:** This repository is the starter *template* for student project repositories. In GitHub Classroom we will use this template so each group gets a well-organized repo with instructions, a design doc, a src folder, etc.

## What to edit after your repo is created
1. Update **Team information** at the top of this file: team name, team members and GitHub usernames.
2. Put lab work in `labs/`
3. Document your meetings in `docs/meeting_notes.md`
4. Fill out `design.md` with your requirements and design as you work on the project.
5. Put code in `src/`, tests in `tests/`, and update `requirements.txt` if needed.
